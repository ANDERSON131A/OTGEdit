Have a new verion of TC, MCW, OTG or OTG+ installed and don't see any saves for it?
Don't worry, TC, MCW, OTG and OTG+ are backwards compatible.

You can load saves for older versions (for instance TC 2.6.3 or MCW 1.0.5) and generate files for
use with newer versions of the mod/plugin. The world should generate without problems. So for example the PG pack saves are in the MCW 1.0.5 
directory but they can be used with newer versions of MCW.

In TCEE be sure to select the corresponding version for the saves you are loading, so select MCW 1.0.5 when loading MCW 1.0.5 saves.
