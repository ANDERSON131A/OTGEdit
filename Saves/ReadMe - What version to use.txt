Have a new verion of TC or MCW installed and don't see any saves for it?
Don't worry, TC and MCW are backwards compatible!

You can load saves for older versions of TC or MCW (for instance TC 2.6.3 or MCW 1.0.5) and generate files for
use with newer versions. The world should generate without problems. So for example the PG pack saves are in the MCW 1.0.5 
directory but they can be used with newer versions of MCW without problems.

In TCEE be sure to select the corresponding version for the saves you are loading, so select MCW 1.0.5 when loading MCW 1.0.5 saves!

The PG Pack pre-sets are made for minecraft 1.7.10, you can easily add ores and resources introduced by newer versions of minecraft though.

There are no saves made using TC 2.7.2 and MCW 1.0.6+ yet. You can manually upgrade existing saves or 
create new saves with TC 2.7.2 or MCW 1.0.6+ selected in TCEE to make use of the new "Biome Groups" feature.

Instructions for manually upgrading save files to TC 2.7.2 or MCW 1.0.6+ will be posted on the mctcp forums in the future.
They are mostly related to the introduction of biome groups and the removal of the "NormalBiomes" and "IceBiomes" settings.
